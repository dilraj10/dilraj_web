<h1>Early Years</h1>
<p><h3>The Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors. The Philadelphia Warriors werean extremely high scoring team 
that chamged the style the game was played forever. One of the most historic moments in NBA history was when Wilt Chamberlain, of the 
Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points in a single game on March 2, 1962. To put that into perspective most teams dont even score that
much in a game, and it was scored by a single player. In 1962 Franklin Mielu purchased the team and moved it to San Francisco. The team
was renamed the San Francisco warriors from 1962-1971. After that the team adopted the name 'Golden State Warriors' in order to represent
the entire state of California.</h3>

</p>

<h1>Success</h1>
<p><h3>The warriors have won 5 championships and 2 of them came very recently. They won in 2015 and 2017 which makes them the defending 
champions this year. They are also heavy favourites to defend their tittle in 2018. In 2016 the warriors had an historic and record
breaking season whem they won 73 out of 82 regular season games. With only 9 losses the entire season it was thought to be an easy
championship for them but they lost to the Cavs 3-4 in the finals. The warriors also have 9 coference titles and 5 division titles to 
their name. They have retired 6 jerseys so far but there will be many more in the future for sure.</h3><p>
